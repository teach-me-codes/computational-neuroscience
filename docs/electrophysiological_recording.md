### What is the principle behind electrophysiological recording techniques such as EEG and MEG?

Electrophysiological recording techniques like Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) play a crucial role in studying brain activity by measuring the electrical signals generated by neural activity in the brain.

- **Electroencephalography (EEG)**:
  - **Principle**: EEG involves placing electrodes on the scalp to detect electrical activity generated by neuronal firing in the brain. These electrodes capture the summed electrical potentials created by the synchronized activity of thousands to millions of neurons.
  - **Measurement**: EEG records these electrical potentials as waves or oscillations, representing various brain states and activities. The amplitude and frequency of these waves provide insights into cognitive processes, emotional states, and neurological disorders.
  - **Applications**: EEG is used in clinical diagnostics, cognitive neuroscience research, sleep studies, and brain-computer interface applications.

- **Magnetoencephalography (MEG)**:
  - **Principle**: MEG measures the magnetic fields generated by the electrical activity of neurons. When neurons fire, they produce small magnetic fields that MEG sensors can detect.
  - **Measurement**: MEG records these magnetic fields to map neuronal activity with high spatial and temporal resolution. It provides detailed information about the brain's dynamic processes in both time and space.
  - **Applications**: MEG is valuable in cognitive neuroscience, clinical neuroimaging, and understanding neural networks involved in various tasks and sensory processes.

By capturing the electrical and magnetic signals generated by neural activity, EEG and MEG offer valuable insights into brain function and neural dynamics.

### How do EEG and MEG differ in their approach to measuring electrical activity?
