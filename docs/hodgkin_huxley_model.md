\]

\[
I_{Na} = G_{Na}m^3h(V_m - E_{Na})
\]

3. **Activation and Inactivation**:
   - The Hodgkin-Huxley Model incorporates activation ($m, h$) and inactivation ($n$) variables to modulate ion channel conductance.
   - These variables are described by differential equations that depend on the membrane potential.

The model equations are as follows (simplified form for one neuron):
$$
C_m \dfrac{dV}{dt} = -\left(g_{\text{Na}}m^3h(V-E_{\text{Na}}) + g_{\text{K}}n^4(V-E_{\text{K}}) + g_{\text{L}}(V-E_{\text{L}})\right)
$$
$$
\dfrac{dx}{dt} = \alpha_x(V)(1-x) - \beta_x(V)x \quad (x = m, h, n)
$$

4. **Simulation**:
   - The Hodgkin-Huxley Model equations are typically solved numerically to simulate the behavior of action potentials.
   - By incorporating these equations in computational simulations, the model can replicate and analyze the dynamics of neuronal action potentials.

### Follow-up Question: 
#### How does the Hodgkin-Huxley Model account for multiple ion channel involvement in action potential generation?
- **Differential Equations**:
  - The Hodgkin-Huxley Model includes separate gating variables for different ion channels (e.g., sodium and potassium).
  - Each ion channel type has specific activation and inactivation variables ($m, h, n$) that control the conductance of that channel in response to the membrane potential.
- **Ion Currents**:
  - By modulating the conductance of different ion channels through their gating variables, the model captures the contributions of multiple channels in shaping the action potential.
  - The model equations explicitly consider the dynamics of individual ion currents and their interactions to accurately represent the complex behavior of neuronal membranes.

In summary, the Hodgkin-Huxley Model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the dynamics of action potentials in neurons by considering the interplay of multiple ion channels and their respective currents in response to changes in membrane potential. This model has been instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms underlying neuronal excitability and signaling processes.
