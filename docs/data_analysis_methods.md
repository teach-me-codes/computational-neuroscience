- **Declaration of Helsinki**: The Declaration of Helsinki outlines ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects and serves as a guiding framework for ethical conduct in neural data research.

- **International Ethical Guidelines**: Researchers may adhere to international guidelines such as the Belmont Report, OECD Guidelines, or Good Clinical Practice for ethical conduct in neural data analysis.

#### Can you give an example of an ethical dilemma encountered in neural data analysis, and how it was resolved?

An ethical dilemma in neuroimaging research could involve the discovery of incidental findings during brain scans that were not part of the initial study objectives. In such cases:
  
- **Resolution**: Researchers must establish protocols in advance to address incidental findings, including consultation with medical professionals, obtaining participant consent for further investigation or disclosure, and ensuring participant welfare throughout the process.

Ensuring that ethical considerations are prioritized in neural data analysis is essential for upholding the integrity of research, protecting participants' rights, and fostering public trust in scientific investigations.
