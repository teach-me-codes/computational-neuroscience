  - *Enhanced Language Fluency*: Studies have reported increased language fluency and retrieval in individuals undergoing TMS-based language therapy.

#### How does tDCS influence language learning capabilities?
- **Enhanced Learning**: tDCS can positively impact language learning capabilities through:
  - *Increased Neuroplasticity*: tDCS fosters neuroplastic changes in the brain, facilitating faster adaptation and learning during language tasks.
  - *Improved Retention*: Enhanced cortical excitability induced by tDCS can promote better retention of linguistic information during learning sessions.

#### Can non-invasive stimulation lead to long-term changes in language processing?
- **Long-Term Effects**: Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have shown the potential to induce long-term changes in language processing:
  - *Neuroplastic Changes*: Continued application of TMS or tDCS can lead to lasting neuroplastic changes in the brain, affecting how language-related areas function.
  - *Sustained Improvements*: Studies have indicated persistent improvements in language functions even after the cessation of stimulation, suggesting long-term benefits of non-invasive techniques.

Overall, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques like TMS and tDCS provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying language processing and offer avenues for enhancing language functions through targeted modulation of brain activity.
